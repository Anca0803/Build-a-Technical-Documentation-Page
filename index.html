            Good research practice presupposes that the entire research process, from thought and idea, through collection and analysism to results and dissemination of research results, is documented and archived in a correct manner. It is also important that all research data collected or produced within a research project is handled correctly throughout the process.
          </p>

          <p>
            Research is surrounded by regulations (laws, regulations, various codes and recommendations) that are there to increase and ensure good scientific quality and to protect researchers, experimental animals, employees and not least the integrity and objectivity of research. These regulations also regulate how research is to be documented.
          </p>
          <p>
            These guidelines complement the governing documents "Guidelines for research at KI" and "Coherent quality system at KI", that more comprehensive regulate research at Karolinska Institutet (KI).</p>

          <p>Guidelines for research documentation and data management at KI summarize how research should be documented and how research data should be handled throughout the life cycle for data and are aimed for everyone who performs research at KI.</p>

          <p>
            KI is responsible for the processing of the research data that researchers at KI collect, the data that is generated and all associated documentation within a research project, even if the project funding is external. This means that KI must protect data from, among other things, unauthorized access and that KI is responsible for confidentiality assessment and possible disclosure of data in accordance with applicable regulations.
          </p>

          <p>
            

For research projects conducted in collaboration with other higher education institutions or actors, it is important that agreements that regulate collaboration and responsibility regarding research data and documentation are drawn up. At each department, the head of department has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the research, which includes documentation, data management, data storage, publication and archiving, takes place in accordance with current regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The individual researcher must follow good research practice and the rules and guidelines that govern research. If a researcher leaves KI and wants continued access to data, the researcher, together with, for example, the new university, can request that data be disclosed. Data disclosure in some cases can be regulated by agreement.

          <p>
            A number of different permits and agreements are usually needed before a project can start and some of these agreements also regulate data management within the project.<>p>
            <p>Requirements for how data is to be handled may occur in ethics permits, biobank agreements, collaboration and assignment agreements, consortium agreements (usually in international collaborations), personal data processing agreements or in financiers' requirements for making documentation and data available in projects they finance.</p>

        <header>Personal information</header>
        <p>
          Personal information is information that can be directly or indirectly traced to a living person. Sensitive personal data refers to information about race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, a person's sexual life or sexual orientation, genetic data and biometric data that uniquely identify an individual.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research projects that collect and process personal data must comply with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and be notified to KI's data protection officer via a web form.
        </p>
        <p>
          All processing of personal data in research must take place in accordance with current regulations for data protection and KI's guidelines for information security. When requesting the disclosure of data containing personal data, a confidentiality assessment must be made.

        <article>
          All research conducted at KI must be documented, either in Swedish or English. 
          <p>
            Employees and others with specialist knowledge must be able to follow and review the research. It is important that the entire research process, from idea and planning to results and conclusions, is described sufficiently clearly and in detail for the research to be traceable, interpretable and reproducible.
           
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many different reasons to document research well: For example,
            
          </p>
           <ul>
             <li>Research ethics: Keeping research organized through documentation, which is central for being able to account for the research process according to good research practice and good data management, is one of the basic principles of research ethics.</li>
             <li>Traceability and ability to repeat analyses and studies (reproducibility): Documentation is crucial for being able to review and troubleshoot collected data and data analyses, as well as for being able to reproduce studies. Documentation of data (metadata) is necessary for being able to verify results and investigate falsified results.</li>
             <li>Reusability: In order for data to continue being used in new research, it must be documented and described. New permits may be required for data reuse. </li>
             <li>Copyright and patents: In Sweden, the academic researcher has the copyright to the research and educational material he creates, as well as the ownership of the patentable patent inventions (the so-called "Teacher Exemption"). Documentation of intellectual work is a prerequisite for obtaining intellectual property protection and applying for patents.</li>
             <li>Cooperation: Documentation is important to avoid unnecessary duplication of work and to improve collaboration between colleagues.</li>

          <p>Research documentation at KI must be done electronically in approved systems, which is why KI provides a central ELN system (electronic notebook) for research documentation.</p></ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="What_should_be_documented?">
        <header>What should be documented?</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Research documentation shall include the intellectual and practical aspects of the research, and, when necessary, refer to the administrative documents, such as funding, permits and agreements, relating to the research.
          </p>

          <p>
            Much of the comprehensive information can be given in a project description with an associated data management plan which is then supplemented continuously with active documentation of the research process where the methods and data management are described and any changes are documented.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The documentation should take place on an ongoing basis and in connection with the research continuation with, for example, analyses and other processing of data and / or materials being documented on the same day as they are performed.</P>
<P>
            Additional information and documentation that could be available is, for example, correspondence and notes of importance to the research, as well as reports and publications.</p>
          <p>I let here couple of example of codes required for this project:</p>
          
        </article>
        <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
          <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
      
        
          <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
            WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
            //statements }</code>
          
          <code
            >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key ="otherValue";</code>
             <code>
x = a;
y = b;
z = x + y

</code>
<code
            >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
            not defined</code>
